//! Trait definitions for implementing custom types that work with `manja`.
//!
//! This module defines various traits used for configuring and interacting with
//! Kite Connect API via `manja`. These traits provide the necessary interfaces
//! for managing API calls, handling authentication, and executing login flows.
//!
//! # Traits
//!
//! - `KiteConfig`: Provides configuration details required for making API calls,
//!     including methods for constructing headers, generating URLs, and accessing
//!     credentials.
//! - `KiteLoginFlow`: Manages the login flow for KiteConnect, defining a method for
//!     generating a request token by executing an asynchronous function.
//! - `KiteAuth`: Adds the `Authorization` header to HTTP requests as required by
//!     KiteConnect, with the `api_key:access_token` combination.
//!
