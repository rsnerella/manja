//! Orders API group: `/orders/`
//!
//! This module provides functionality to interact with the orders-related
//! endpoints of Kite Connect API.
//!
//! Placing an order implies registering it with the OMS via the API. This does
//! not guarantee the order's receipt at the exchange. The fate of an order is
//! dependent on several factors including market hours, availability of funds,
//! risk checks and so on. Under normal circumstances, order placement, receipt
//! by the OMS, transport to the exchange, execution, and the confirmation
//! roundtrip happen instantly.
//!
//! When an order is successfully placed, the API returns an `order_id`. The status
//! of the order is not known at the moment of placing because of the aforementioned
//! reasons.
//!
//! Refer to the official [API documentation](https://kite.trade/docs/connect/v3/orders/).
