//! Portfolio API group: `/portfolio/`

//! This module provides functionality to interact with the portfolio-related
//! endpoints of Kite Connect API.
//!
//! A user's portfolio consists of long term equity holdings and short term
//! positions. The portfolio APIs return instruments in a portfolio with up-to-date
//! profit and loss computations.
