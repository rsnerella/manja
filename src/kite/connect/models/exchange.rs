//! `Exchange` enum.
//!
//! This module defines the `Exchange` enum, which represents various exchange options available for trading.
//! It includes implementations for converting from and to different types, as well as helper methods
//! for determining exchange properties such as divisors and tradability.
//!
//! The `Exchange` enum supports serialization and deserialization using Serde, making it suitable
//! for use in JSON or other data formats.
