//! User profile related types.
//!
//! This module provides structures and functions for managing user profiles,
//! margins, and other related information in the Kite Connect API. It includes
//! detailed representations of user profiles, segment details, available and
//! utilized balances, and segment kinds.
//!
//! The key components of this module are:
//!
//! - `UserProfile`: Represents the user's profile, including user ID, email,
//!     name, broker details, and products enabled.
//! - `Meta`: Represents additional metadata associated with the user's profile.
//! - `UserMargins`: Represents the user's margins for equity and commodity segments.
//! - `Segment`: Represents the details of a specific segment, including available
//!     and utilized balances.
//! - `Available`: Represents the available balance details within a segment.
//! - `Utilised`: Represents the utilized balance details within a segment.
//! - `SegmentKind`: Enum representing the different types of segments (commodity
//!     and equity).
