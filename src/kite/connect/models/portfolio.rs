//! Portfolio related types.
//!
//! This module defines various structures and enums related to the user's
//! portfolio holdings, positions, and related actions in a trading system.
//! It provides detailed representations of holdings, positions, auctions, and
//! position conversion requests, making it easier to manage and process
//! portfolio activities.
//!
//! The key components of this module are:
//!
//! - `Holding`: Represents a holding in the user's portfolio, containing
//!     long-term equity delivery stocks.
//! - `Auction`: Represents an auction currently being held, with details about
//!     the security being auctioned.
//! - `Position`: Represents a position in the user's portfolio, containing short
//!     to medium-term derivatives and intraday equity stocks.
//! - `PositionType`: Enum representing the variety of positions, either overnight
//!     or day positions.
//! - `PositionConversionRequest`: Represents the request parameters required for
//!     converting a position's margin product.
//!
