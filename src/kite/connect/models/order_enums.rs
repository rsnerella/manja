//! Order related enums.
//!
//! This module defines various enums representing the attributes and statuses
//! of trading orders. It provides a comprehensive set of enums to manage order
//! varieties, statuses, types, product types, validity, and transaction types,
//! which are essential for placing and managing orders in a trading system.
//!
//! Additionally, `fmt::Display` trait has been implemented for each enum, enabling
//! easy conversion to their string representations. This is particularly useful
//! for logging, debugging, and routing API requests based on order attributes.
//!
//! # Enums
//!
//! - `OrderVariety`: Represents the different varieties of orders such as regular,
//!     after market, cover, iceberg, and auction orders.
//! - `OrderStatus`: Enumerates the various statuses an order can have during its
//!     lifecycle, including both common and intermediate statuses.
//! - `OrderType`: Defines the types of orders that can be placed, such as market,
//!     limit, stoploss, and stoploss-market orders.
//! - `ProductType`: Specifies the product type for an order, including cash and
//!     carry, normal, and margin intraday squareoff.
//! - `OrderValidity`: Indicates the validity period of an order, such as day,
//!     immediate or cancel, and time to live.
//! - `TransactionType`: Represents the type of transaction, either buy or sell.
//!
