//! Order and trade related types.
//!
//! This module defines structures related to orders and trades. It includes
//! detailed representations of orders, trades, and their various attributes,
//! making it easier to manage and process trading activities.
//!
//! # Structures:
//!
//! - `OrderReceipt`: Represents an acknowledgment receipt when an order is
//!     successfully placed.
//! - `Order`: Represents an order in the trading system, containing details
//!     such as order status, timestamps, and execution parameters.
//! - `Trade`: Represents a trade executed at the exchange, providing information
//!     about individual executions that fulfill an order.
//!
